        <h2 class="secHead">Currently Working on</h2>
        <h4>AI Code Decipherer</h4>
        <p>The AI code decipherer's goal is to recognize different coding languages used in a single image. It has two main parts to it.
            The first being the machine vision part which takes a photo with text in it and recoginizes the text within the image. The second part will be taking all the nuances of different languages
            and being able to interpret what language is being displayed with a confidence meter. This should be easy for telling the difference between languages such as Java and C but may be difficult between very similar languages(C and C++).
        </p>
        <h4>Website Design</h4>
        <p>Web design is something I always found interesting. Learning the frontend stuff while also making it look nice is the main 
            goal for designing a website like this. It also gives me a place to talk about myself a bit more while also learning two new
            "languages". What I have learned so far is that HTML is pretty easy to do. As for the CSS side... I'm not sure yet. I'm not the best at making things look really nice
            but I'm hoping the website is somewhat aesthetically pleasing. 
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="secHead">Researching</h2>
        <p>Currently I am learning HTML, CSS and AI topics. The main focus is machine vision
            where I want to learn how to make my own text recognition model(mainly for the project above).
            As for the HTML and CSS research most of it is learning how they work together since I have a decent background in knowing
            how html works. CSS is something that is completely new to me so I have been enjoying the learning process
            and want to use it to make this website visually appealing. 

        </p>
    
        <h2 class="secHead">Past Projects</h2>
        <h4>Lunch Money</h4>
        <p>Lunch Money is a project my friends and I coded for a hack-a-thon. We did it in a group of 4 people,
            my friends, Usman and Zayn, and one random. I mainly assisted in all parts of the python web scraping while also somewhat assisting in
            the web design. The purpose of the project was to create a webscraper that gets afforable nutrious ingredients
            from target. We won 2 different categories with this project and I was really happy with the results. 

        </p>
        <h4>UI Grade Calculator</h4>
        <P>I created a grade calculator because the one on Canvas wasn't that good. I created this in python originally without a UI,
            this did everything in the terminal and even had a saving data feature. I then wanted to get into
            tkinter and went down a rabbit hole trying to design the UI. I was glad I did this project because it made me realize I
            am not a big fan of UI/UX and that I would rather stick to backend coding.
        </P>
        <H2 class="secHead">School Projects</H2>
        <h4>Mock Shell</h4>
        <p>This was one of my favorite projects in my OS class. We basically designed a shell which took whatever the user
            put as an input, parsed the input, forked, change the child to whatever command the user put, do the process,and then get reaped. It was mostly used to 
            teach us about how child processes are created and killed. We
            also allowed commands to become a background process, had piping and added some of 
            our own commands. I thought the most interesting part was the background process part since that had us use flags to know
            when to reap the dead processes.  
        </p>
        <h4>Mock PollEV</h4>
        <p>This was another project done in my OS class. For this project we made a basic PollEV
            polling server in C. I liked this project a lot because it introduced us to threading and mutex locks
            which was something I was intrested in. We had a few different mutex lock types which ranged from fine grain to 
            reader/writer mutexes. As for the multithreading part, it felt easy except for terminating threads which I had gotten
            a little confused with while writing. The server/client structure we used involved establishing a connection to the client, then creating a user profile(if they were a unique user)
            and logging them in. Sending the data from the polls to the user was one of the harder parts of the project in my opinion because it involved a lot of resizing the memory of the string dynamically. 
            It also allowed me to appreciate how hard making something 
            multithreaded can be. 
        </p>
        <h4>Traveling Salesperson Using Heuristics</h4>
        <p>Traveling salesperson was a cool unsolved problem we were given. 
            We had to write four different algorithms to find total shortest path possible with the fourth one being whatever you wanted it to be. 
            We wrote this in Java and each algorithm had its own principle to follow(i.e. greedy). This was a peer programming project we did in high school. 

        </p>
        <h4>AI Minesweeper</h4>
        <p>During my most recent quarter at UCI, I took an intro to AI class. In this we had to design an algorithm to solve minesweeper. We were given different boards
            and had to find a way to solve them(although all of them weren't necessarily solvable). For this project
            I mainly used a greedy principle for dealing with the squares which did not have any bombs near, then I had the program look at the squares with a danger level of 1 and so on.
            I had a lot of fun with this project because we were only given the base game and had to approach it in our own way. I think my favorite part was how we were supposed to have a competition between other students in the class.

        </p>
        <h4>Code Interpreter Project</h4>
        <p>In python, we had to make our own code interpreter for a language our professor made up. The language
            was simple(no spaces in between each line of code) and we had to approach each line in our own way.
            Overall this project was one of my favorites just because we created our own coding language which functioned in the python terminal. The way you would know if
            the user was done writing was by having a period on the last line. We were able to create variables, do addition, do multiplication, jump around on the lines and have conditionals in the 
            code.
